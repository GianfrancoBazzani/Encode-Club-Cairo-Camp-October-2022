# Homework 4

1. **Install a wallet for such as Braavos or ArgentX.**

	**Braavos [Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/braavos-wallet/jnlgamecbpmbajjfhmmmlhejkemejdma)**
	
	**ArgentX [Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/argent-x/dlcobpjiigpikoobohmabehhmhfoodbb)**
	
	**Set up an account on Starknet using the wallet. How does this differ from your experience with accounts and wallets on Ethereum ?**
	
	The difference that I noted is that I have to deploy an account contract to be able to use the network. Another thing that I noted is the fact that, for multiple deployed accounts, the recovery mnemonic is the same for all, but each one has its unique private key.
	

2. **Cairo exercises**


	**Complete program exercises 1 to 7 in [this repo](https://github.com/ExtropyIO/CairoBootcamp)**

	**You need to clone the repo and follow the instructions in the README.**
